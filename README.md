# Domain-Adaptation

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8L11aMN5KY8/maxresdefault.jpg)

Extension to YOLOv3 person-detection model by incorporating domain adaptation on 3D synthetic images, allowing for synthetic-to-real translation tasks using Cycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) for one-to-one mapping framework.

A PyTorch implementation of (Bayesian) CycleGAN inspired by [Zhu et al. (2017)]() and [You et al. (2020)]().
